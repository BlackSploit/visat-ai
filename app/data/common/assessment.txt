students who have not passed the course must take the examination based on 
the modified syllabus. No further examinations under the original syllabus will 
be permitted. 
Candidates in each semester shall be evaluated both by Continuous Internal Evaluation 
(CIE) and End Semester Examinations (ESE). Unless specifically mentioned in the 
curriculum, the ratio of Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) to End Semester 
Examinations (ESE) shall be as follows:

learning mode instead of attending regular classes or MOOC courses.  
The evaluation for self-study courses will be conducted in a similar manner as 
for regular theory courses. 
The attendance percentage accrued during the internship period will be 
considered equivalent to class attendance for all courses. 
Students doing internships at a location different from their college may deliver 
their Semester 7 seminar in an online mode. The seminar will be evaluated using 
the same criteria as in-person seminars.

Calculation of SGPA/CGPA - Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) 
• The SGPA earned by a student is a quantitative indication of the student’s 
performance in a semester.  
• The SGPA is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the 
courses registered by the student in the current semester. 
SGPA Calculation: 
• For each course registered, the grade points earned are multiplied by the 
credits for that course. 
• The sum of all such credit- grade point products is then divided by the total 
credits registered in that semester to calculate the SGPA for that semester. 
SGPA =   ∑ (𝐶𝑖 × 𝐺𝑃𝑖)
𝑛
𝑖=1
∑ 𝐶𝑖
𝑖=1
Where: 
• n is the number of courses in the semester. 
• ‘Ci’ is the credit assigned for the ith course. 
• GPi is the grade point earned in the ith course. 
• The calculation includes all grades, including 'F', 'Ab', and 'FE' grade 
courses.  
•  'F', 'Ab', or 'FE' grades are assigned a grade point of 0 
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) 
R 9.1 
R 9.2 
• The CGPA indicates the overall performance of a student from the time of 
joining the programme to a specific semester.  
• It is calculated by taking the weighted average of the grade points obtained 
in all the courses registered by the student since the first semester. 
CGPA Calculation: 
CGPA =   ∑ (𝐶𝑖 × 𝐺𝑃𝑖)
𝑖=1
∑ 𝐶𝑖
𝑚
𝑖=1
Where: 
• m is the total number of courses considered in the CGPA calculation. 
•  ‘Ci’ is the credit assigned for the ith course and ‘GPi’ is the grade point for 
that course.  
• The summation is done for all courses specified in the curriculum up to the 
semester for which the CGPA is being calculated. 
• The calculation includes all grades, including 'F', 'Ab', and 'FE' grade 
courses.  
CGPA Calculation for Students Admitted under the Lateral Entry Scheme: 
i. For students admitted under the lateral entry scheme, credits for the first and 
second semester courses shall not be included in the calculation of CGPA. 
ii. The Consolidated Grade Card and Official Transcript for B. Tech. lateral entry 
students shall include the statement: "A total of 44 credits have been awarded 
based on the credits earned from the qualifying Diploma/Degree Programme." 
Non-Computable Courses for SGPA and CGPA: Courses that are not considered for the computation of SGPA and CGPA 
shall be explicitly listed in the curriculum. 
Exclusion of Minor, Honours, and Challenge Examinations. 
• Courses pursued towards a ‘Minor’ or ‘Honours’ specialization, as well as 
credits earned through challenge examinations, shall not be included in the 
calculation of SGPA or CGPA for the main B. Tech. programme.  
GPA and CGPA shall be calculated to two decimal places. 
Percentage Equivalent of CGPA: The percentage equivalent of a CGPA is calculated by multiplying the CGPA by 10. 
A CGPA of 8.95 is considered equivalent to 89.5% (8.95 x 10 = 89.5%).
Activity Credits Requirement for B. Tech. Students  
A student must earn 3 credits by actively participating in co-curricular and extra
curricular activities, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the University
