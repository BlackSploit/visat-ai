Structure of BTech Programme
The duration of the B. Tech. Programme shall be 4 years (8 semesters). 
There are four options for completing a B. Tech
“B. Tech.” in an Engineering Major 
Discipline. 170 Credits,
[167 Academic Credits (as per R 7.22) +    
3 credits from student activities] 
“B. Tech. with Minor”  
(Minor in any Discipline, other than 
the Major Discipline), 185 Credits 
[170 Credits (B. Tech.) +  
15 Credits   for Minor Coursework]  
B. Tech. with Honours” 
 (Specialization within the Major 
Discipline), 185 Credits 
[170 Credits (B. Tech.) +  
15 Credits for Honours Coursework] 
“B. Tech. with Honours and Minor, 200 Credits 
[170 Credits (B. Tech.) +  
15 Credits   for Honours Coursework+ 
15 Credits   for Minor Coursework] 
Minimum Credits for Graduation: Students who acquire at least 160 credits (157 
academic credits + 3 Mandatory credits from student activities) after the 
completion of the normal programme duration of eight semesters shall be 
eligible for the B. Tech. Degree. 
Credit Shortfall Allowance: This policy allows students to graduate even if they 
are unable to earn credits for courses totalling up to 10 credits. 
Exclusions from Credit Relaxation: The credit relaxation does not apply to 
Seminar, Mini Project, and Project/Internship, all of which are mandatory and 
must be completed to qualify for graduation. 
Credits earned for Minor will not be considered towards the 160-credit minimum 
requirement. 
Impact on CGPA due to unacquired credits: For courses where a student is 
unable to earn credits under the credit relaxation policy, a grade point of '0' will 
be assigned. This zero-point value will be factored into the calculation of both 
the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point 
Average (CGPA), potentially resulting in a reduction of the overall CGPA. 
Despite a potential reduction in CGPA due to assigned zero-grade points, 
students who successfully acquire the minimum 160 credits will be eligible for 
graduation under this regulation, provided they fulfil all other requirements as 
outlined in R 11. 
Credits for Minimum Requirement (160 Credits): If a student has not acquired 
the 160 credits required for the B.Tech. degree as per the credit relaxation policy, 
the credits earned from Honours theory courses, along with the extra 2 credits 
from Level 5 courses, will count towards fulfilling the 160 credits (157 academic 
credits + 3 credits from student activities) requirement for the B.Tech. degree.
These additional credits will also be included in the calculation of both the SGPA 
and the CGPA.  
Students who benefit from this credit consideration will not be eligible for the 
award of the B. Tech. degree with Honours. 
Academic Year Structure: Every academic year is structured to include: an Odd semester, an Even semester, and 
a Summer semester. The Summer semester, typically scheduled during the months of 
May and June, provides students with the opportunity to engage in internships or 
pursue additional skill courses to enhance their academic and professional 
development. 
Minimum Working Days: • Each semester shall have a minimum of 90 working days out of which 65 days 
shall be instructional days. 
• In the event that holidays are declared by the district collector or the state 
government, the institutions are required to reschedule the lost instructional days 
within the same semester, including Saturdays, to ensure the timely completion 
of the syllabus.
The academic activities in a semester shall normally include the following: 
• Commencement and completion of the semester 
• Semester enrolment dates 
• Course selection and mapping dates 
• University exam registration dates 
• Schedule of Internal examinations 
• Date of publishing of attendance and internal marks 
• Schedule of End Semester examinations 
• Dates of Extra/Co-curricular activities.  
• Submission of Student activity points 
• Dates of Internal and External academic audit 
• Internship dates/Vacation dates.
A curriculum refers to a structured and prescribed list of courses within a programme, 
organized in a specific format. It outlines the academic pathway for a particular 
programme and includes courses categorized under various heads, such as University 
Core, University Elective, Programme Core, Programme Elective, Open Elective etc. 
This structured approach ensures that students receive a comprehensive education, 
covering essential courses/subjects while also providing options for specialized study 
within their chosen field. 
A syllabus is a comprehensive document that outlines the learning objectives, content, 
and structure of a specific course. It includes essential details such as the course title, 
course code, course type, and delivery modes—Teaching Hours/Week (L-T-P-R). 
Additionally, it specifies the credits assigned to the course, Continuous Internal 
Evaluation (CIE) Marks, End Semester Examination (ESE) Marks, exam duration, 
and prerequisites.  
The syllabus also provides the course objectives, expected course outcomes (CO), 
CO-Programme Outcome (PO) mapping, prescribed textbooks, reference materials, 
assessment patterns, and question paper format (where applicable). This document 
serves as a guide for both students and instructors, detailing the learning expectations 
and assessment methods for the course.
The syllabus for any course shall typically be updated once in every four years. 
However, innovative elective courses, open electives, industry-linked electives, 
and industry-linked minors may be introduced as needed.  
ii. The syllabus of any course offered in the curriculum can be modified or updated 
based on technological changes and emerging requirements.  In any case, the 
modifications to core courses shall not exceed 30%.  
iii. All syllabus revisions shall be made exclusively on the recommendations of the 
relevant Board of Studies (BoS) and are subject to the approval of the Academic 
Council, with subsequent reporting to the Syndicate and the Board of Governors. 
The academic programmes of the University are based on credit system. The 
curriculum for any branch of the B. Tech. Programme shall comprise a total of 170 
credits, which includes 167 academic credits and 3 mandatory student activity-based 
credits. 
Credits shall be awarded for all courses listed in the curriculum. Courses in the 
curriculum are classified into 1, 2, 3, or 4 credit courses based on the chosen content 
delivery method and the desired depth of the course.  
The delivery methods include Theory only, Theory with Tutorial, Theory with 
Lab/Practice, Theory with Project, Lab only and Massive Open Online Courses 
(MOOC). The L-T-P-R notation for each course signifies the allocation of hours for 
content delivery in terms of Lecture (L), Tutorial (T), Practical (P), and Project (R) 
per week. 
Self-Study Hours (SS): In addition to lecture, tutorial, practical/practice, and project 
hours, the curriculum includes Self Study Hours. Self-Study Hours refer to the time 
students are expected to dedicate to independent learning activities outside of 
scheduled classroom instruction.  
These activities may include reviewing lecture notes, completing assignments, 
engaging in further reading, practicing problems, or working on projects without 
direct guidance from instructors or tutors. The Self Study Hours per week for each 
course are calculated as:   
SS Hours= 1.5 L + 0.5 T + 0.5 P + R 
Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) for Level 5 Courses: 
Viva Component: A viva component shall be included in the Continuous Internal 
Evaluation for Level 5 courses. The viva will be conducted with an external subject 
expert, who must be a faculty member from another college affiliated with KTU. The 
viva shall be conducted during the last week of the semester in which the course is 
offered. 
There will be only one internal examination for Level 5 courses, with the internal 
mark distribution as follows: 
i. Attendance: 5 Marks 
ii. Internal Examination: 15 Marks 
iii. Assessment of Bloom's Taxonomy Levels: 
▪ Analyze: 5 Marks 
▪ Evaluate: 5 Marks 
iv. Viva: 10 Marks 
Maximum Duration for the Completion of B. Tech. Programme 
Additional Grace Period: If a student has backlog courses remaining after the normal course duration 
of four years, the student will be permitted an additional grace period of two 
years to complete all courses and credit requirements specified in the curriculum. 
Automatic Cancellation: After this period, the student's registration will be automatically cancelled 
unless an extension is granted by the university. No separate intimation 
regarding this cancellation will be sent to the student.
